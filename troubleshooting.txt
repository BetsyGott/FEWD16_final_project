issues to bring up:

how do I manipulate the header bg image so that I can determine what part of the image I want to see (instead of having it center and I can't choose)

how do I make the size of the .cityexample a's correct to fit the images so they don't stretch weirdly?


how do I position the rating and tag areas relative to the parent div?




What I have left to do (in order of likelihood to complete in time):

1. Write Review Functionality (JS)
	- Add areas for user icon upload and photo upload
	- Use Tag-it plugin to add hashtag ability
	- write JQuery to create variables for all the input selections to get saved into
	- style submit button so that clicking the nicely styled "Submit Review" button acts as submit
	- when submitted, change all the existing variable areas of the default review to reflect the new review info

2. Responsive Design (CS)
	- fix responsive design of page so it looks good at smaller sizes:
		- fixed menu at top (hamburger if I can manage it, maybe you click the plop icon?)
		- improved spacing 
		- fix float sections that look weird
		- get rid of some extraneous text 


3. Create Account Functionality (JS)
	- clicking "create account" opens a pop-up form to fill in your info (does not actually save but will look cool)
	- submitting the form gives you a Thank you! screen.

4. Search Bar Functionality (HTML, CSS, JS)
	- look for a plug in?
	doesn't have to actually work but it should look like it will

5. Make big links actually do something
	- "more cities": make a pop up appear that says coming soon
	- clicking on a city will take you somewhere or give you a pop up.
	- small links at the bottom don't need to go anywhere.
